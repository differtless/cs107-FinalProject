    "## Introduction \n",
    "Differentiation of functions helps find the maxima, minima, and zero points that are essential for optimization and prediction in scientific problems. Automatic differentiation (AD) is a computational approach that automatically finds the derivatives of a function using a computer program. For a given function, the AD software should be able to compute the derivatives of any order with machine precision. \n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation is different from classical methods such as symbolic differentiation and numerical differentiation, as AD method requires much less computational time and is not affected by numerical instability unlike classical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Differtless is a software package for performing AD, with additional functionality for performing optimization to find stationary points of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Automatic differentiation is based on the decomposition of differentials using chain rule. Separated by the order of chain rule calculation, AD can be divided into two modes: forward mode and reverse mode. The forward mode calculates derivatives from the inner function to the outer function using chain rule repeatedly, while the reverse mode calculates from outside to inside. \n",
    "We can also say the forward mode calculates the product of the function's Jacobian matrix $J$ with the seed vectors specified by input variables, while reverse modes computes the product of the transpose of Jacobian matrix $J^T$ with  seed vectors. In a function with $m$ inputs and $n$ functions, represented by $R^m \\rightarrow R^n$, forward mode is more efficient when $n$ >> $m$, while reverse mode is more efficient when $n$ << $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A computational graph is useful in visualizing the propagation of elementary operations that construct the function to be auto-differentiated. From here, it is easy to evaluate the numerical value after each operation, the derivatives of the elementary operations, and numerical values of derivatives with respect to each input variable.\n",

    "## How to use Differtless\n",
    "\n",
    "Our user will import `differtless`. Then when they have a function that they would like to automatically differentiate, they will: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the function, using either elementary operations (which we have overloaded- add, subtract, etc) or `differtless` operations for elementary functions (e.g. `differtless.operations.sin`, `differtless.operations.exp`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. User will preprocess their function inputs to create `differtless.ad.FuncInput` objects (and define their own seed matrix if they choose to, otherwise will default to the identity matrix)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Call the forward function with their pre-defined function and inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return the value and corresponding derivatives.\n",

    "Our implementation, through class `FuncInput` takes advantage of a `list` for storing derivative information. The `list` structure allows us to store multiple values with low overhead. A `tuple` could also be used, but the immutability of `tuple`s could cause unforseen issues later on.\n",

    "* `preprocess` function\n",
    "    * Allows us to deal with scalars and vectors\n",

    "    * If the user inputs a scalar it will be converted to a 1 x 1 vector\n",
    "    * `seeds` defaults to None, in which case we will use an N x N identity matrix where `N = len(inputs)`\n",
    "    * For each value in `inputs` (and if the inputs are vectors, each component in each vector) and row in `seeds` we will instantiate the `FuncInput` object described below\n",
    "* `FuncInput` class\n",
    "    * Parameters: `input` (value – `float` or `int`) and `seed` (seed vector – `list` or `numpy.array`) \n",
    "    * The class will have two instance variables: `self.val = value` (value) and `self.der_val = seed` (list of derivative values)\n",
    "    * In this class we will use dunder methods for operator overloading of elementary operations (e.g. `__add__, __sub__, __mul__, __floordiv__, __truediv__, __mod__, __pow__`) to return evaluation and derivative\n",
    "    * In our `Operations` module we will implement other elementary operations (e.g. sin, exp)\n",
    "    * In both cases the methods will return a new instance of `FuncInput` with the `evaluation` and `[evaluation of derivatives]` as inputs\n",
